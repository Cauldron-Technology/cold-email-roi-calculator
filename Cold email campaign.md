## 1. Overview and Assumptions

- Platform: Instantly.ai Supersonic (100,000/month sending, 4,500 new leads/month)
- Infrastructure: 10 Google Workspace accounts (5/account/domain), 2 domains (annual, paid upfront)
- Sequence: One cold email per new lead each month, follow-up only if new leads run out and quota remains
- Reply rate: 2% (conservative)
- Work days: 5/week
- Objective: Maximize replies; support later ROI modeling


## 2. Activity Timetable / Step-by-Step TODO

**Week 0 (Setup: Days –7 to 0)**

- Purchase 2 domains, set up SPF/DKIM/DMARC
- Register and configure 10 Google Workspace accounts
- Create Instantly.ai account, attach domains/accounts
- Prepare and test cold email template with clear CTA (“claim free credits”), webhook for auto-onboarding
- Draft and test lead segmentation/criteria (if desired)

**Month 1: Warm-up \& Initial Outreach**

- Week 1: Warmup at 5 emails/day/account, upload/send to 250 new leads
- Week 2: 10 emails/day/account, upload/send to 500 new leads
- Week 3: 20 emails/day/account, upload/send to 1,000 new leads
- Week 4: 30 emails/day/account, upload/send to 1,500 new leads
- Ongoing: Monitor deliverability, reply promptly, clean bad addresses

**Months 2 \& 3: Full Campaign Velocity**

- Each week: 30 emails/day/account × 10 × 5 days = 1,500/week to new leads
- Upload lists weekly as needed
- Track responses, claims, product tries, conversions
- Monitor health metrics (opens, bounces, reputation, etc.)

## 4. Monthly Cost Breakdown

| Cost Item | Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 3 |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Instantly Supersonic (4,500 leads/month) | \$194 | \$194 | \$194 |

| Domains (2; annual, upfront) | \$28 | — | — |
| **Total** | **\$282** | **\$254** | **\$254** |

## 5. Lead Usage and Capacity

- Month 1: Up to 3,250 unique leads (warmup-limited), each touched once
- Months 2/3: Up to 6,000 unique leads/month (plan and sending capacity aligned)
- Always prioritize new leads—use follow-ups only if you run out of inbound for that month and have sending headroom


## 6. Strategic Outreach Sequence

- First: Contact as many new leads as allowed/supplied by your plan and sending volume
- If new pool exhausts but sends remain: Use a single follow-up to selected non-responders from previous cohorts
- Maximize uniqueness/coverage; ensure the highest number of prospects enter your funnel each month


## 7. Summary Table: Three-Month Campaign Metrics

| Month | Emails Sent | Unique New Leads | Replies (2%) | Total Monthly Cost |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Month 1 | 3,250 | 3,250 | 65 | \$282 |
| Month 2 | 6,000 | 6,000 | 120 | \$254 |
| Month 3 | 6,000 | 6,000 | 120 | \$254 |

## 8. Key Recommendations

- Always maximize initial outreach to new leads. Only follow up if you have excess capacity without sacrificing fresh contacts.
- Maintain list hygiene and prompt bounce management.
- Monitor sender reputation weekly.
- Track results by funnel stage: reply → credit claim → trial → paid.
- Refine segmentation and messaging monthly for improvement.


## 9. Realistic Funnel Scenarios: True Paid Conversion Modeling

**Not every trier becomes a buyer. This section models the actual likelihood, using conservative, realistic, and cautiously optimistic rates based on industry norms and campaign specifics.**


| Step | Conservative | Realistic | Optimistic | Benchmarks / Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Emails Sent | 1,000 | 1,000 | 1,000 | Reference window |
| Open Rate | 25% | 35% | 45% | B2B cold SaaS |
| CTA Click (of opens) | 8% | 12% | 16% | Clear “get free credits” |
| Try Product (of CTA) | 25% | 30% | 40% | Typical "free" SaaS usage |
| Become Paid (of triers) | 10% | 20% | 30% | Only fraction convert |
| 40 Credit Buyers | 55% of buyers | 55% | 55% | Of those that pay |
| 60 Credit Buyers | 45% of buyers | 45% | 45% | Of those that pay |

**Example funnel, per 1,000 emails sent:**


| Funnel Step | Conservative | Realistic | Optimistic |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Opens | 250 | 350 | 450 |
| CTA Clicks | 20 | 42 | 72 |
| Tries Product | 5 | 13 | 29 |
| Paid Buyers | 0.5 | 2.6 | 8.7 |
| 40 Credit Buyers | 0.275 | 1.43 | 4.79 |
| 40 Credit Revenue | \$3.16 | \$16.45 | \$55.09 |
| 60 Credit Buyers | 0.225 | 1.17 | 3.92 |
| 60 Credit Revenue | \$3.32 | \$17.24 | \$57.89 |
| Total Revenue | \$6.48 | \$33.69 | \$112.98 |

**Assumptions:**

- Paid buyers are a subset of all “triers.”
- 40 and 60 credit purchases are proportions of those who pay, not of all triers.
- Product prices used: 40 credits = \$11.50, 60 credits = \$14.75.
